To avoid high latitudes where ice or gales might be " & Chr(13) & Chr(10) & "encountered, a modification of great circle sailing called ""composite sailing"" may be used.  There are two methods used to accomplish this.  In Method 1, " & Chr(13) & Chr(10) & "a great circle route is plotted from the point of departure to the destination and is followed from the point of departure until it crosses the limiting " & Chr(13) & Chr(10) & "latitude, then the parallel of the limiting latitude is followed until the great circle again crosses it, then the great circle route is followed to the " & Chr(13) & Chr(10) & "destination.  In Method 2, one great circle is plotted from the point of departure tangent to the limiting parallel, and a second from the destination " & Chr(13) & Chr(10) & "tangent to the limiting parallel.  The first is followed from the point of departure to the limiting latitude, then the parallel of the limiting latitude is followed " & Chr(13) & Chr(10) & "until the second great circle reaches it, then the second great circle is sailed to the destination.  Method 1 is easier to plot, but Method 2 results in a " & Chr(13) & Chr(10) & "shorter course.

In the Law of Cosines, all values of latitude, LHA, and declination are rounded to " & Chr(13) & Chr(10) & "five decimal places, to conform to the method used in the examples in the JN and N student manuals, and these values are used in subsequent " & Chr(13) & Chr(10) & "calculations.  The calculated value of Hc is rounded to five decimal places, and this value is used in subsequent calculations.
